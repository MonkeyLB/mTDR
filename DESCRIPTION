Description: Enrichment-based chromatin profiling sequencing experiments have become 
             essential tools to investigate the functional roles of genomic regions. 
             Measuring reproducibility is central to the data quality control, and 
             critical to ensure thecredibility of scientific discoveries. Evaluating
             the reproducibility of enrichment-based sequencing data is complicated 
             by the variation of enrichment characteristics and the heterogeneous 
             correlation structure between replicated samples. We present a 
             model-based method to comprehensively assess the reproducibility between
             replicated samples. The method only requires minimum preprocessing of 
             raw data and does not rely on peak calling. Thus it involves less 
             information loss than the peak level reproducibility measure. The model 
             is designed to assess three aspects of the data reproducibility ? the 
             dependence between the enriched signals, the bulk correlation across 
             whole range of signal values, and the degree of lack of enrichment. 
             By the combination of the three quantities, our model is flexible to 
             assess the reproducibility of data with different signal types 
             (i.e., narrow-peak, broad-peak) and enrichment levels. We demonstrate
             that our method is also more accurate than the other existing measures.
